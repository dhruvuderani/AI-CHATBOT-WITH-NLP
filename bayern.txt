Bayern Munich, officially known as Fußball-Club Bayern München e. V. (FCB), is a German professional sports club based in Munich, Bavaria. Recognized globally as one of the most successful football clubs, Bayern is most famous for its men's team, which competes in the Bundesliga, Germany’s top football division. The club has secured a record 34 national titles—including an unprecedented eleven consecutive championships from 2013 to 2023—and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honors.

Established in 1900 by eleven players led by Franz John, Bayern won its first national title in 1932. However, it wasn’t part of the Bundesliga when the league was launched in 1963. The club rose to prominence in the late 1960s and 1970s, particularly under Franz Beckenbauer’s leadership, capturing the European Cup three times in a row from 1974 to 1976. Bayern has claimed a total of six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles—the most by a German club—with their sixth win coming in 2020 as part of a treble-winning season. They are one of only five European clubs permitted to keep the trophy permanently and wear the multiple-winner badge.

Bayern has also triumphed in other international competitions, including one UEFA Cup, one Cup Winners’ Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups. Notably, Bayern is the only German club to have won both the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup. Individual players from the club have received prestigious accolades such as five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, five European Golden Shoes, and three UEFA Men’s Player of the Year honors.

With their 2020 FIFA Club World Cup victory, Bayern became only the second club to achieve the "sextuple"—winning six major trophies across one season and the following calendar year. As of June 2025, Bayern ranks second in UEFA's club rankings and remains the only German club to have won all three of UEFA’s main club competitions. Long-standing rivalries include 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg.

By July 2025, Bayern Munich had more than 400,000 official members and 4,286 registered fan clubs with over 325,000 fans, making it the world’s largest sports club by membership. The club also supports departments in sports like basketball, handball, chess, table tennis, bowling, gymnastics, and senior football, with over 1,100 active members.

Bayern has played home matches at the Allianz Arena since the 2005–06 season, after spending 33 years at Munich’s Olympiastadion. Their traditional team colors are red and white, and the crest features the Bavarian flag. Financially, Bayern leads all German sports clubs in revenue and is ranked fifth globally among football clubs, with earnings of €764.5 million in 2025.
